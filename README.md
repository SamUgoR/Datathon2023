Breaking Silos - Datathon 2023 project

Geneva is the hub of over 600 international institutions. Every day, important decisions that save or improve peopleâ€™s lives are taken here in Geneva. Among this 600+ institutions, only 40 of them publish their CO2 emissions on the 2050Today website. General estimation of CO2 emission can already be done as published by the Swiss government ( see dataset panel) By matching the more detailed data from 2050Today with the emission map from the Swiss government, more detailed estimations can be made for non reporting international institutions in Geneva.


## Problem Statement

Reporting CO2 emissions requires resources in terms of time and labour and very little reward is offered in return. In terms of data quality reported, if the data is measured in more detail, it oftentimes increases the recorded emissions of the institutions. In this case punishing all the institutions which put in more of the efforts as more polluting. Hence only a limited number of organisations present their CO2 emissions publibly. We aimed to set out to change these inequality, with visually presenting who reports and give a CO2 estimation of who does not report.
